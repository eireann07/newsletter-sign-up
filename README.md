Built to practice using Mailchimp API
- Deployed online using Heroku at https://agile-tor-41182.herokuapp.com/

**What I enjoyed while building this app:** Learning how to use and call APIs, since that's such an essential part of web development!

**What I struggled with while building this app:** The brief instructions from my bootcamp were a bit out of date -- Mailchimp's updated their interface significantly since the instructions for the assignment were written, and it was really difficult to figure out how the new interface reflects old functionality. Because of the huge changes, building out success and failure pages that correctly redirected was really complicated. 

**Things I learned through building this app:** Teamwork and pair programming are really important. I would not have been able to figure out how to untangle my project issues without being able to talk through and debug with my classmate, Brianna. That she and I worked on the same project, though building out our own sites, was extremely helpful. She saw errors I didn'd and vice versa.
